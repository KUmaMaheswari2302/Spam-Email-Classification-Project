# Spam-Email-Classification-Project
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This project is about creating a machine learning-based application to determine whether a given email is spam or not. This system processes text emails, classifies it as either "Spam" or "Ham," which refers to the absence of spam, and therefore helps to increase email security through filtering of unwanted messages. This model is efficient because it uses natural language processing techniques in its analysis to classify content.</p>
<h1>Technologies used</h1>
<h2>python libraries</h2>
<p>Streamlit: For building the web application interface.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Numpy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model and vectorizer.
